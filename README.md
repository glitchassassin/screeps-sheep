# Screeps Sheep

Screeps Sheep is an NPC bot that provides alternative ways to score! The Sheep will normally move slowly, but will flee from enemy creeps in a predictable way - use this to corral the Sheep and herd them back to your room. If you succesfully herd the Sheep back to one of your spawns, you score points, visible in the Sheep's public segment #0!
